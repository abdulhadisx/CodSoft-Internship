    <p>In 1994, he released his debut solo album, Junaid of Vital Signs followed by Us Rah Par in 1999 and Dil Ki Baat in 2002. In 2004, Jamshed left both his engineering and music careers and, afterwards, focused on his religious activities for Islam and reciting nasheeds on TV and releasing them on CDs. Jamshed also owned a clothing boutique with the name "J." (read as "Jay Dot"), which has several outlets throughout Pakistan and some abroad.

        In November 2014, Jamshed was accused of blasphemy and in December 2014, in a video message, he apologized for offending people and making mistakes.[7][8]
        
        Junaid Jamshed and his wife died on 7 December 2016 when PIA Flight 661 crashed in Havelian. The flight was en route to Islamabad from Chitral. He was in Chitral for a Tablighi Jamaat mission and was returning to Islamabad.[9][10] </p>

                <h1>Education</h1>
                <p>Early life and education

                    Junaid Jamshed was born in Karachi to Jamshed Akbar Khan (d. 2016), a group captain in the Pakistan Air Force from Nowshera, and Nafeesa Akbar Khan, the granddaughter of the nawab of Loharu State.[11] His maternal uncle Sahibzada Jahangir,[12] nicknamed "Chico", is a businessman based in London who has been one of the founding members of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, and whose son Sherry Jahangir was an actor better known for his role as M.A. Jinnah in PTV classic drama Jinnah Se Quaid, while another son, Kafeel Jahangir, was an England-based domestic cricketer who has played as an all-rounder for Hertfordshire.[13] Other relatives include politician Fauzia Kasuri, who was his aunt,[14][5] and actor Alyy Khan, his cousin.[15]
                    
                    After graduating from an international boarding high school in Yanbu' al Bahr in Saudi Arabia, Jamshed wanted to join the Pakistan Air Force to become a fighter pilot.[16] However his weak eyesight prevented this. He then entered the University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore, where he took mathematics and physics before declaring his major in mechanical engineering. In 1990, Jamshed gained a Bachelor of Science degree, graduating in mechanical engineering.[17]
                    
                    After graduating with a degree in engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore, Jamshed briefly worked as a civilian contractor and engineer for the Pakistan Air Force before focusing on a musical career.[18][19][20] </p>

                <h1>Music Career</h1>
                <p>Vital Signs

                    Although the band Vital Signs began in early 1986 in Rawalpindi by Keyboardist Rohail Hyatt and bassist Shahzad Hasan (Shahi), it was not until later that Jamshed, then a young engineering student from UET Lahore, joined them as their lead singer.[citation needed] They began performing in different parts of the country after having secured a place in the underground music industry in Islamabad and Lahore. In a live concert in Islamabad, the band got noticed and approached by the music officials of the PTV, and a record deal was awarded by Rana Kanwal, a student of the National Academy of Performing Arts.[citation needed] Kanwal was given an assignment in which she wanted to make a music video and she wanted to make one of a music band. The band moved to Islamabad and began working on the first album for Kanwal, then-known as "Chehra" (lit. Face). According to Hyatt, "the song we created for her was Chehra. It was the first song we wrote as an entity and it was also a part of our first album." During this time, the band caught the attention of record producer and broadcaster Shoaib Mansoor who also taught at the National Academy of Performing Arts. Mansoor became acquainted with the band and worked on their first album, spearheading the writing of a patriotic song.[citation needed]
                    
                        We looked around and then we thought of Junaid, who was in a mediocre band and he was the best part about the band, he was a very good singer and with his good looks and great vocals, was the bona fide front man.</p>

                <h1>Drift From music</h1>
                <p>As early as 1999, the media began speculating about Jamshed's drift from music soon after the Vital Signs faded away. The speculations soon died after Jamshed released his solo albums and continued world tours. After 2001, Jamshed disappeared from the public eye and avoided media attention. His last two albums did not do well in the market and failed to get any positive response from the country's music critics. His former bandmates, Shahi and Hyatt, saw him struggling to negotiate the transition from one world to another.[16] He became distant from Hyatt, who continued to work on producing music.[16] He also struggled financially after leaving the Vital Signs band, and it was Shoaib Mansoor who came to help him financially after giving him the role in Gulls & Guys television show.[16]

                    After the 9/11 attacks in the United States, Hyatt and Jamshed's tours in the West struggled with a lot of questions from Westerners about the country's culture, terrorism, and music.[16] Upon returning, Jamshed filed for bankruptcy in court and made an attempt to resume his career in engineering after applying at various companies.[16] Theories regarding Jamshed began to arise in media, therefore media outlets hired some paparazzi to follow Jamshed.[16] It was frequently reported that Jamshed had distanced himself from music and had been praying five times a day regularly at the nearby mosque. Finally, Jamshed who had been out of practice from his engineering career for 20 years, announced that he would open a fashion-designing company with a close friend of his.[16] In 2004, Jamshed officially renounced music after announcing that he had devoted his life to Islam.[23] Jamshed then left engineering and, to supplement his income, he opened the clothing store "J.", selling Khaadis (a form of Kurta-Shalwar).[16] </p>

                <h1>Junaid Jamshed Death</h1>
                <p>Jamshed was in Chitral, along with his second wife, Nayha Junaid, for a Tablighi Jamaat mission. On 7 December 2016, the two were returning to Islamabad aboard PIA Flight 661, which crashed near Havelian, Khyber Paktunkhwa, killing all on board. Jamshed was en route to deliver the Friday sermon at the Parliament mosque. He is survived by his first wife, Ayesha, three sons, and a daughter.[26] On 15 December 2016, his funeral prayer offered in Moin Khan Academy, Karachi where Tariq Jamil led and Junaid's fans attend the prayer.[4] In 2018, Jamshed was posthumously nominated for the nation's third highest civilian honour, the Sitara-i-Imtiaz.[27].</p>
